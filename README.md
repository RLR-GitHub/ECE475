**[ðŸ“„ View the Final Project PDF](https://github.com/RLR-GitHub/ECE475/blob/master/ECE475_FinalProject_RLR-1.pdf)**

This course introduces fundamental concepts and practical skills for computer hardware design using VHDL. Students gain hands-on experience in modeling, simulating, and implementing digital systems, focusing on embedded solutions and real-world applications.
Course Highlights

    VHDL-Based Digital Design: Learn the basics and advanced features of VHDL for synthesizable hardware description.
    Embedded Systems: Apply design methods to create, test, and deploy embedded hardware projects.
    Project-Driven Learning: Reinforce concepts through labs and comprehensive design assignments.

Flagship Accomplishment

    Neural Network Implementation (Final Project):
    Students complete a full-featured neural network implementation in VHDL as a capstone project.
        Standalone repository: MultilayerPerceptron
        Demonstrates advanced hardware design and digital signal processing skills.

Repository Structure

    All course materials, labs, and example code are provided in VHDL.
    For embedded systems and advanced digital design, see the MultilayerPerceptron project.
